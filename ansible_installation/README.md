# Ansible Installation
This directory has the purpose to guide you through the installation and configuration of Ansible, considering that all the respository consists of Ansible automation artifacts.

## Setup script
The _setup.py_ is the main script file for installing Ansible.
To use this file, you may declare some parameters in the command line, for example:
```
python3 setup.py --ansible_version "2.19.0" --log_directory "/home/username"
```

For help on how to use the command line parameters, execute the following command:
```
python3 setup.py --help
```
